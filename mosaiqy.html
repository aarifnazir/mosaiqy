<p>Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained
in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout
was stupefied.  This sentence ruined his master.  A wager of twenty thousand pounds
lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!
Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him,
did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced. Just as the clerk
was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."</p>

<p>Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce
that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds.
"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag,
which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk.</p>
